# UdacityPopularMovies

This is a project created for Udacity Associate Android Developer Fast Track program I am currently enrolled in.

## How to use the app

App uses [theMovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch its data and you will need to provide your own api-key. Please add this line to your user's gradle.properties:
```
MyTmdbApiToken="<YOUR-API-TOKEN>"
```
